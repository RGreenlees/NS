# Natural Selection v3.3

This is an updated build of the game [Natural Selection] for Windows and Linux focused on quality of life improvements and bug fixes.

## Downloads

Install the game using one of the following methods:

**[Natural Selection Launcher](https://github.com/ENSL/NaturalLauncher/releases/)** (recommended for Windows) The launcher can install, update, or repair the game.

**[Manual installation](https://github.com/ENSL/NS/releases)** (Linux / OSX / Windows)

As the game is a Half-Life mod, Steam and Half-Life installations are required to play the game.

A fresh install of NS comes with updated config files containing everything you need to get playing on the standard settings most players prefer. Customization options are also built in like the Nine Legends competitve UI option as well as team and weapon specific config files that can be edited.

## Game not working? Troubleshooting tips.

If the game doesn't load, check the following:
1. Make sure you have verified Half-Life integrity. Click [here](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335) for detailed instructions.
1. Make sure you have **clean** install. Go to half-life directory (eg. `c:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life`) and remove or rename ``ns`` folder.
1. Check if Half-Life or any other half-ife mods (eg. team fortress classic) works for you.
1. Update your graphics card drivers.
1. Make sure you have not any additional command line options for NS.

## Changes

Updates include:

- Natural Selection Launcher for installing and updating the game
- Widescreen support (now expands FOV up to 16:9 aspect instead of cutting it off)
- AI upscaled model textures can be turned on with the "Use High Definition models" video option 
- Many FPS dependencies fixed, including jetpack acceleration, so the game can now be fairly played at 200+ FPS
- Quake style queued jumping to make bunnyhopping more accessible (server adjustable via sv_jumpmode)
- Shotgun and grenade launcher have been reworked to fix reload bugs
- Weapon reloads are now predicted on the client
- New minimal HUD and the Nine Legends HUD can be selected through advanced options or hud_style and hud_mapstyle
- New crosshair system that can be adjusted through the advanced options and cl_cross commands (Thanks [OpenAG](https://github.com/YaLTeR/OpenAG))
- Ambient sounds can be changed in advanced options or via cl_ambientsound
- Marine HUD now tracks research progress
- Raw input and sensitivity scaling options now available

- Numerous bug fixes

## Compiling

For Windows, compilation should be working if you have VS2019 installed.

For Linux:

First you need some libraries. On Ubuntu it is:

```sh
apt-get install build-essential git gdb gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-i386
``` 

Then you will need to get the files:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/fmoraw/NS.git
``` 
Then cd to the linux directory:
```sh
cd NS/main/source/linux
```

Then build
```sh
make
```
or `make ns` to build the server binary and `make cl_dll` for the client binary. `make clean` to clean.

If you get the this error when running the app: `Fatal Error - could not load library (client.so)`, With a high chance it is because of some `UNDEFINED SYMBOLS` in the shared library. But you can check this with this command:

``` sh 
ldd -r -d client.so
``` 

Make sure you have vgui.so copied to the cl_dll folder too on Linux.

## Debugging

Windows debug builds are currently broken.

If you want to debug:
```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" gdb ./hl_linux r -game ns -dev -steam
``` 
Due to the new engine and the nature of Linux I had to make a lot of changes! You can find them with grep -Ril `@Linux`.

For MacOS & lldb:
```
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/lldb -- ./hl_osx r -game ns -dev -steam -windowed
```
Have to use XCode's lldb to get around https://stackoverflow.com/a/33589760 (Lack of environment variables). `-windowed` as windowed mode makes it easier to deal with crashes on MacOS.

### Hosting a server

Since servers are really rare at this point in time here is a tutorial how to set up an [Natural Selection] server with [hlds]. 

1. Follow these steps: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD
2. Copy the [Natural Selection] directory to steamcmd/servers/
3. Run the game : 
```sh
./hlds_run -game ns -autoupdate +map ns_eclipse + sv_secure 1 + port 27015 + ip 127.0.0.1 +hostname "Natural Selection" +maxplayers 32
``` 
If you are behind a NAT(Router) make sure to open at least those ports: 
- 27015 UDP (game transmission, pings) 
- 26900 UDP (VAC service) -- automatically increments if used in case of additional server processes

`Under no circumstances expose your host to the internet!!!` For more information follow [this link](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half-Life_Dedicated_Server).

In order to check if you server is connected to the steam servers copy the following url in your browser and replace `<your IP address>` with your external ip:
`http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetServersAtAddress/v0001?addr=<your IP address>&format=json`

There is an updated version of metamod called [metamodp](http://metamod-p.sourceforge.net/). Since players are also pretty rare you might want to install [rcbot] and therefore you have to download those files:
 - [rcbot without dlls](http://filebase.bots-united.com/index.php?act=download&id=210)
 - [rcbot linux dlls](http://filebase.bots-united.com/index.php?act=download&id=428)
