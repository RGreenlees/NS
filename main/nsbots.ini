### General bot settings ###

# What prefix to put in front of a bot's name (can leave blank)
Prefix=[BOT]

# After this many minutes into a match, the bots will leave the game if there are no humans playing
# Helps prevent stalemates and bugs that happen after extremely long matches
# Default = 90 minutes
MaxAIMatchTime=90

# When should the server start adding bots? Note: bots will always be added after round start regardless
# 0 = On map load (after 5 second grace period)
# 1 = When all humans have joined a team (i.e. no more humans left in ready room)
# 2 = When the round has started (after countdown)
BotFillTiming=1


### Skill Settings ###

# Bot skill settings. There are 4 settings from 0 - 3 for easiest - hardest
# Use BotSkillName=<index> to start defining a skill level, then the following:
# ReactionTime = How quickly in seconds the bot will react to sighting enemies
# AimSkill = How accurately the bot can lock sights on you after seeing you (0.0 - 1.0)
# MovementTracking = How accurately the bot can follow a moving target (0.0 - 1.0)
# ViewSpeed = How fast the bot can swivel its view (0.1 - 2.0)
# Set the difficulty using the 'mp_botskill' cvar (0 - 3)

### Alien Settings ###

# Preferred chamber sequence. Valid entries are 'defense', 'movement' and 'sensory'. Separate sequence with forward slash
# You can also use ? for random, so if you want movement always first but then defense and sensory at random, use
# ChamberSequence:movement/?/?
# Or if you want sensory always last, but movement and defence random, use
# ChamberSequence=?/?/sensory
ChamberSequence=?/?/?
